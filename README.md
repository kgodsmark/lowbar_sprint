# Lowbar I - Arrays and Objects

## Goals

1. Continue practicing test-driven development (TDD) - both the process and the
tools you'll be using to do it from now until the end of the course (and beyond).
2. Get an 'inside view' of one of the most heavily used JavaScript libraries
[underscore](http://underscorejs.org/) (11m downloads on NPM last month) and
get used to reading its API documentation.
3. Lay the foundations for understanding the functional style of programming that JS lends itself so well to.

## Tasks

On this sprint we'll implement our own version of the popular utilities library Underscore.js. The methods you should implement are listed below, but feel free to implement any others you find interesting if you finish.

## Core

These are the core functions you should aim to get finished;

1. identity
2. values
3. first
4. last
5. each
6. indexOf
7. filter
8. reject
9. uniq
10. map
11. contains

You should be heavily referencing the APIs of the following;

1. [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/)
2. [The Mocha Test Framework](https://mochajs.org/)
3. [The Chai Assertion Library](http://chaijs.com/)

## Advanced

These are a little harder but will be very beneficial to try and complete.

1. pluck
2. reduce
3. every
4. some
5. extends
6. defaults
